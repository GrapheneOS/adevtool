This directory contains FileTreeSpecs for vendor modules of each of the supported devices.

FileTreeSpec specifies SHA-256 digest of each file in a file tree, and lists out all of its directories.

FileTreeSpec is used by `adevtool generate-all` command to verify vendor module that it generated against 
a reference module.

Reference module is generated by `adevtool generate-all --updateSpec` command, which writes a new
FileTreeSpec to this directory.
