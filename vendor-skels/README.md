This directory contains adevtool-generated text files from vendor modules for each of supported devices.

These files are stored here to record their changes to git history. They are not used for vendor module generation. 

Note that .mk and .bp files have .skip suffix added to their names to prevent soong from detecting them,
which would break the build.
